//! # Status codes
//!
//! Status codes for UEFI interfaces.
//!
//! Most `usize` values can represent a valid status, but only a few are
//! defined by the UEFI specification. Ranges are reserved for use by the UEFI
//! specification itself, the [Platform Initialization specification][PI Spec],
//! and OEM usage. On a 64-bit platform, these ranges are:
//!
//! | Start                   | End                     | Usage         |
//! | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
//! | `0x0000_0000_0000_0000` | `0x1FFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF` | UEFI warnings |
//! | `0x2000_0000_0000_0000` | `0x3FFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF` | PI warnings   |
//! | `0x4000_0000_0000_0000` | `0x7FFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF` | OEM warnings  |
//! | `0x8000_0000_0000_0000` | `0x9FFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF` | UEFI errors   |
//! | `0xA000_0000_0000_0000` | `0xBFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF` | PI errors     |
//! | `0xC000_0000_0000_0000` | `0xCFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF` | OEM errors    |
//!
//! Error codes always have the highest bit set, while success and warnings
//! always have the highest bit cleared.
